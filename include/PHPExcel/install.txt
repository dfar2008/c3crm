The following requirements should be met prior to using PHPExcel:

Installation instructions
-------------------------

Installation is quite easy: copy the contents of the Classes folder to any location
in your application required.

Afterwards, make sure you can include all PHPExcel files. This can be achieved by
respecting a base folder structure, or by setting the PHP include path, for example:

set_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . '/path/to/PHPExcel/');
